<title>Using the Recipe Viewer</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The recipe viewer, as you might expect, is where you can view your recipes.
This activity is divided into three sections. At the top is the recipe
information, such as the name, time, and rating. The necessary ingredients are
shown in the middle section of the screen, in a column format common to many
cookbooks. At the bottom, you can find the recipe's directions.</p>
<p>Some recipes contain photos, typically of the finished product. If you are
viewing a recipe with a photo, a thumbnail will be shown on the right-hand side,
next to the ingredients. You can touch this photo to display a full-sized image.</p>
<p>The "Start Timer" menu option displays a digital timer in the bottom-right
portion of the screen, to the right of the recipe's directions. Much like your
ordinary kitchen timers, just set the desired time, touch the "Start" button,
and wait for the "ding". (To hide the timer, use your device's "Back" button.)
