<body>
<p>The flipbook mode allows you to see all of the recipes in your current list
at a glance, like flipping through the pages of a cookbook. Just flick to the
left or right to change pages.</p>
<p>Flipbook mode uses the same layout as the recipe viewer: general information
on the top, ingredients in the middle, and directions at the bottom. Also, if
the recipe has an attached photo, it will be shown to the right of the
ingredients. The only difference between flipbook mode and viewer mode is that
the flipbook does not have the digital timer available.</p>
<p>To return to the recipe list, press your device's "Back" button, or use the
"Switch to List" menu option.</p><figure class="menu-item"><img
