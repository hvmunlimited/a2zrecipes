    <title>Using the Recipe List</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>The recipe list is the front page of your cookbook, the table of contents.
At a glance, you can see all the recipes that you have created or imported, and,
with a simple touch, you can go to any one of them. There's even more to it than
that, though.</p>

<p>By touching and holding a recipe entry, you can open a context menu that
will allow you to edit or delete an existing recipe, add tags to it, or change
its rating.</p>

<p>You can add a new recipe to your cookbook by using the "Create New Recipe"
menu option, which will take you into the recipe editor. <figure><img

<p>The recipe list offers a few ways to search through your cookbook, all of
which are accessed through the appropriate menu options. You can search by text,
including both the name of a recipe and its description, or you can search for
all recipes that have a particular tag. Tags can be added to or removed from
recipes when you edit them, or they may be included in imported recipe books.
You can also search for recipes by time; for example, you can instruct the app
to only display dishes that take less than an hour to prepare.</p>

<p>Once you have only the recipes you wish to see, you can sort them in a few
different ways. Using the menu options, your cookbook can be sorted by recipe
name, creator, rating, or time.</p>

<p>When you're done searching through the cookbook, and ready to show the whole
thing again, just use the "Show All Recipes" menu option. <figure><img

<p>The "Export Recipes" option lets you save some of the recipes from your
cookbook into a file on your device. You can use this, for example, to share
recipes with your friends. After you choose the menu option, select the recipes
that you want to export--you can choose as many as you want--and hit the
"Export" button. A file will be created containing the selected "pages" of your
cookbook. You can send this file like any other.</p>

<p>Importing recipes into your cookbook works in much the same way. Use the
"Import Recipes" option to bring recipes into the app from files in your
Downloads folder. These files will have names that end in ".rcp", and are
created by exporting, as described above. (Some browsers and file managers will
also allow you to open an "rcp" recipe file directly, which will also take you
to the importer screen.)</p>

<p>Finally, if you just want to flip through your cookbook one page at a time,
like the real thing, you can switch out of the recipe list and into flipbook
mode. This turns the currently shown list of recipes (using your current search
results and sorting options) into an old-fashioned cookbook with one recipe per
page. <figure><img src="../drawable/menu_flipbook.png" /><figcaption>Switch To
