    <title>Using the Recipe Editor</title>

<body>
<p>The recipe editor is the main way for you to enter recipes into your
cookbook. The editor contains four sections, and you can switch between them by
using the menu on the left. (On larger screens, all four sections may be on the
screen at once.)</p>
<p>The first section, "Recipe Information", is where you can edit the general
information about a recipe. Here you can give your recipe a name, write a brief
description, and note how long the recipe will take, among other things. Except
for the name, everything is optional, though the app expects you to at least try
to fill as many fields as you can. (For example, you don't have to enter the
time for your recipes, but, if you do, you can use the "time search" function
later.)</p>
<p>The second section is a simple list of ingredients. You can touch and hold an
ingredient that is already in the list to remove it or edit it. Also, note that
the app does not check your ingredients in any way, though later versions will
offer a "search by ingredient" function.</p>
<p>Directions or steps go in the third section. Again, this is a simple list,
but with a twist. Because the order of steps is important for a recipe, the
touch-and-hold menu allows you to move individual steps up and down in the list.</p>
<p>The fourth section is where you can tag a recipe. You can use as
many tags as you like, and they can be named whatever you wish. (If you tag your
recipes consistantly, then the "search by tag" function will be very helpful if
you have a large cookbook.)</p>
<p>Finally, each recipe can have an associated picture. This can be any image on
your device, and the chosen image will appear with the recipe in the viewer and
flipbook display modes.</p>
<p>When you're done, hit the "Save" option, and your recipe will be saved into
your cookbook.<figure class="menu-item"><img
